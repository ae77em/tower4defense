#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.h"

//~ Exactly one source file must #define either CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN or
//~ CATCH_CONFIG_RUNNER before #include-ing Catch. In this file do not write
//~ any test cases! In most cases that means this file will just contain
//~ two lines (the #define and the #include).
